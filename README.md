# SerialTerminal
Another Serial port Terminal written in C#, as Electronic Enginieer I used to the Dockligth Serial terminal
so when move to linux I tried to get a serial terminal with same funtionalities but only some apps (moserial, cutecom)
have some functionalities so I write one my self.

I chose C# because is the language that have skill for. (and is multiplatform).

Thats it.
