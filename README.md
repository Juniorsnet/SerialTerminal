# SerialTerminal
Another Serial port Terminal written in C#, as Electronic Engineer I was used the Dockligth Serial terminal so when I moved to linux I tried to get a serial terminal with same functionalities but only some apps (moserial, cutecom) have only some functionalities so I write one my self.

I chose C# because is the language that I have skill for. (and is multiplatform).

Thats it.
